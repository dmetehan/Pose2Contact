# Pose2Contact

Pose2Contact is the unimodal method proposed in the paper "Decoding Contact: Automatic Estimation of Contact Signatures in Parent-Infant Free Play Interactions".

Our better performing multimodal approach can be reached via [Image2Contact](https://github.com/dmetehan/Image2Contact)

To annotate your own data with contact signatures you can use our annotation tool [HumanContactAnnotator](https://github.com/dmetehan/HumanContactAnnotator)
